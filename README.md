User Stories 
1- As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events
that take place in that city.
2. As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less
information about an event.
3. As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the
app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
4. As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events
I viewed the last time I was online.
5. As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I
can open the app faster.
6. As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each
city so that I know what events are organized in which city
